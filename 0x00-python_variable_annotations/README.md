# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

## Description
This project is part of the curriculum of ALX's short specialization program focusing on back-end development using Python. It's designed to deepen understanding of variable annotations and type checking in Python. The project is facilitated by Emmanuel Turlay, a Staff Software Engineer at Cruise.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, learners should be able to explain:
- Type annotations in Python 3
- Usage of type annotations in specifying function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing and its use cases
- Code validation using mypy

## Requirements
- **Editor:** vi, vim, emacs
- **OS:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.7
- **Coding Style:** PEP 8 style (version 2.5.x)
- **Documentation:** Each module, class, and function must be properly documented

## Tasks
### 0. Basic annotations - add
Create a type-annotated function `add` that takes two floats and returns their sum as a float.

### 1. Basic annotations - concat
Develop a type-annotated function `concat` that concatenates two strings.

### 2. Basic annotations - floor
Implement a type-annotated function `floor` that returns the floor of a float.

### 3. Basic annotations - to string
Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float and returns its string representation.

... (additional tasks continue in the same pattern)
